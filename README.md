# Online-Lecture-Scheduling

Description
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to facilitate lecture scheduling for educational institutions. It allows administrators to add courses, assign instructors to lectures without scheduling conflicts, and manage multiple batches for each course. The system ensures that no two lectures clash with each other in an instructor's schedule. Instructors can view their assigned lectures, including dates and course names, through a dedicated instructor panel.
